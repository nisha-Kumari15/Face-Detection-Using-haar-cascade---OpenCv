# Face-Detection-Using-haar-cascade---OpenCv
Face Detection : In this I have used the concept of Haar-cascade detection in OpenCv. It detects the face of the person and then saves it in the database. If the database of that person is not available, it will create a folder by the person's name and then it will save the data.
