# Face-Detection-Using-haar-cascade---OpenCv
Face Detection : In this I have used the concept of Haar-cascade detection in OpenCv. It detects the face of the person and then saves it in the database. If the database of that person is not available, it will create a folder by the person's name and then it will save the data.

For Example:
In my local system a folder called database is created inside another folder of that person's name is created. I have removed the detected photos but you can try it on your local system by detecting your face.
